# Brand Voice Constraints

## Do

- Be {{brand_voice|default:"confident, friendly, concise"}}.
- Lead with the **useful idea**; keep intros short.
- Use concrete nouns, active verbs, and specific numbers.
- Prefer lists and short sentences.

## Don’t

- No hype, shilling, or vague superlatives.
- No private or sensitive data; no unverifiable claims.
- Avoid jargon unless the audience expects it; define terms once.
- Keep emojis/hashtags minimal (≤ 2) unless explicitly allowed.

## Language & Tone

- Write in {{language|default:"en"}}; localize idioms if not English.
- Inclusive, respectful, and non-discriminatory.
- Cite sources or say “unknown” if you don’t know.

## Formatting

- Text: ≤ 180 words; Carousel captions: ≤ 14 words/slide.
- One idea per paragraph; blank lines between paragraphs.
- End with a lightweight CTA aligned to {{cta|default:"save/share/DM"}}.
